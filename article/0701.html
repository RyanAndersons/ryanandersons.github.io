<p>Ryan Anderson believes that the market performance of last week can be summarized as "mixed movements of gainers and losers with calm trading." Although the major U.S. benchmark indices had mixed performances on Friday, the overall market sentiment remained relatively calm. Specifically, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 1.45%, the Russell 2000 increased by 0.79%, the S&P 500 gained 0.61%, while the Nasdaq remained flat. Notably, the equal-weighted S&P 500 outperformed the official index by 56 basis points, indicating that market attention is shifting from tech stocks to a broader range of sectors.</p>

<p>The primary question in the current market is whether this rally will extend beyond the tech sector or if it signals the start of widespread selling. Driven by the AI boom, tech fund inflows have reached record levels. However, after questioning the profit growth prospects, tech investors have reduced their holdings in Nvidia, introducing a degree of uncertainty into the market. Additionally, the Japanese yen has fallen to its lowest level in 34 years, approaching the levels that triggered suspected intervention in April, posing new challenges to global financial market stability.</p>

<p>In this context, investors need to closely monitor market dynamics, especially the performance of tech stocks and the reaction of the broader market. While tech stocks have been performing well due to the AI boom, it remains to be seen whether this can continue. At the same time, stocks in other sectors may also have upward potential driven by the tech stock rally. Investors should carefully assess market risks and diversify their portfolios to cope with potential market volatility.</p>

<h3>Market Analysis</h3>

<p>Ryan Anderson notes that despite the overall stable market performance last week, underlying complex factors should not be overlooked. First, the rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 reflects investor optimism about economic prospects. However, the flat performance of the Nasdaq indicates the vulnerability of tech stocks amid high valuations. The AI boom has indeed attracted substantial inflows into tech funds, but whether this can translate into long-term stable profit growth remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The main challenge for tech stocks currently lies in the skepticism of the market about their profit growth prospects. For example, although Nvidia holds a leading position in the AI field, the expectations of investors for its future profit growth are declining, resulting in reduced holdings. This phenomenon suggests that there are concerns about the high valuations of tech stocks, and investors should be wary of potential pullbacks.</p>

<p>In the international market, the continued depreciation of the Japanese yen has garnered widespread attention. Ryan Anderson points out that the fall of the yen to its lowest level in 34 years not only reflects the pressure faced by the Japanese economy but also has profound implications for global financial markets. Investors holding significant yen assets need to be particularly cautious about the exchange rate risks posed by the depreciation of the yen.</p>

<p>Ryan Anderson advises investors to closely monitor market dynamics and diversify their portfolios to achieve stable investment returns. Especially in the current market environment, diversification and flexibility are crucial.</p>
