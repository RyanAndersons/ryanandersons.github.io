<p>Last week, the phenomenon of overselling was particularly prominent in resource stocks. Ryan Anderson believes that current global economic fluctuations have profoundly impacted the Australian stock market.</p>

<h2>Oversold Resource Stocks and Investment Opportunities</h2>

<p>Ryan Anderson highlights that capital raising, disappointing quarterly reports, and weak commodity prices are the main reasons many resource stocks have entered oversold territory. Heavyweight stocks such as Paladin Energy, South32, Fortescue, and Woodside show significant oversold signals in their Relative Strength Index (RSI). South32 RSI is only 22, indicating its stock has fallen too quickly and may rebound.</p>

<p>The quarterly report of South32 revealed a substantial decline in its financial status, with production expectations for the 2025 fiscal year downgraded. The new conditions of Western Australia Environmental Protection Authority for the Worsley Alumina refinery forced South32 to write down $830 million from its alumina business value. These negative factors overshadowed stable production in other areas, leading to a continuous decline in stock prices. However, Anderson remains cautiously optimistic about the future of South32, suggesting that its stock price has potential for an uptick post-adjustment.</p>

<p>Despite the significant financial and operational pressures faced by South32, its low valuation offers potential investment opportunities. Morgan Stanley points out that although Worsley has abundant resources and a mine life of 60 years, recent issues and impairments indicate significant changes in mine planning, which could negatively impact operating costs. Investors should consider these risks alongside the long-term development prospects of the country when evaluating investments.</p>

<h2>Investment Strategies Amid Market Volatility</h2>

<p>Amid increased market volatility, investors need to adopt more cautious investment strategies. Ryan Anderson notes that Iress is the most overbought stock in the ASX 200, with an RSI of 84. Iress stock price surged 17% after the company updated its report, primarily due to an upward revision in the 2024 fiscal year EBITDA range and the announcement of the $164 million sale of its UK mortgage business. These positive developments elicited a favorable market response, with analysts raising target prices.</p>

<p>Although Iress is potentially overbought, its guidance upgrade, successful transformation plan, and positive broker reactions may continue to drive up its stock price. Macquarie, Jefferies, Morgans, and JPMorgan all hold optimistic views on Iress future and have raised their target prices. Investors should carefully assess its future growth potential and market sentiment when considering such stocks.</p>

<p>Anderson emphasizes that RSI, as a momentum indicator, can effectively help investors determine stock buy and sell timing. An RSI of 70 or above indicates overbought conditions, possibly leading to a pullback; an RSI of 30 or below indicates oversold conditions, possibly leading to a rebound. Investors should combine RSI and other technical indicators with fundamental company analysis to formulate sound investment strategies and avoid blindly following trends.</p>

<p>The current oversold phenomenon in resource stocks in the Australian market presents potential buying opportunities for investors. By combining RSI and other technical indicators with fundamental company analysis, investors can find reasonable investment strategies amid market volatility. Despite facing financial and operational pressures, the low valuation and long-term resource advantages of South32 provide some investment value. Iress, driven by positive market sentiment, also has potential for further gains.</p>

<p>Ryan Anderson believes that investors should remain calm in the current market environment and not be swayed by short-term market fluctuations. Operationally, a phased approach to building positions at low levels can help reduce investment risk. Additionally, keeping an eye on global economic and political developments allows for timely adjustments to investment portfolios. Through in-depth analysis of market dynamics and company fundamentals, investors can find suitable investment opportunities in a volatile market and achieve long-term stable returns.</p>
