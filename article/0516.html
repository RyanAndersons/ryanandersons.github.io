<h3>Analysis of Poor Performance in the Industrial Sector</h3>
<p>In the current market environment, several sectors are performing poorly, with the industrial sector (XNJ) and real estate investment trusts (XPJ) showing the worst performance, both down by 0.88%. Although there are no major reports from these sectors, Ryan Anderson believes that the weakness in the industrial sector is mainly due to the drag from Seven Group Holdings Limited (ASX: SVW) and Fletcher Building Limited (ASX: FBU).</p>

<p>Ryan Anderson mentioned that the stock price of Seven Group Holdings Limited dropped by 3.0%, while Fletcher Building Limited plummeted by 4.2%. The latter was further impacted despite the profit of yesterday downgrade and the current broker price target cut. Ryan Anderson stated that the performance of these companies directly affected the overall performance of the industrial sector, further dragging down market sentiment.</p>

<h3>Performance Analysis of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)</h3>
<p>Ryan Anderson believes that the poor performance of real estate investment trusts (XPJ) is also worth noting. Although there are no major reports, the uncertainty of the market about the future economic environment has undermined the confidence of investors in real estate investment trusts. Ryan Anderson mentioned that the market expects interest rates to rise, which will increase the financing costs for real estate companies, thereby affecting their profitability.</p>

<p>Ryan Anderson stated that in this situation, investors should be cautious about investing in real estate investment trusts, especially in an unclear market outlook, maintaining a flexible investment strategy is particularly important. He advised investors to pay attention to market trends, allocate assets reasonably, and reduce investment risks.</p>
