<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ryananderson000/" rel="follow">Ryan Anderson</a> believes that natural gas plays a crucial role as a transitional fuel in the energy transition of Australia. One of the largest pension funds of Australia, HESTA, with total assets of AUD 83 billion, holds at least 0.5% shares in Woodside Energy Ltd and Santos Ltd. This indicates that, despite the push towards net-zero emissions, large investment institutions still recognize the key role of natural gas in achieving this transition.</p>

<p>At the ESG Summit of the Australian Financial Review, Ryan Anderson emphasized the necessity of supporting natural gas as a transitional fuel. He pointed out that achieving this transition is an "extremely urgent" task, and funds will be directed towards companies that can address this issue. The Australian pension fund industry plays a critical role in urging producers to tackle emission issues, which make Australia one of the most polluted countries per capita. Despite the commitment of the government to net-zero emissions by 2050, the liquefied natural gas (LNG) export industry last month welcomed government support for continuing the use of natural gas beyond 2050.</p>

<h3>Balancing Natural Gas and Renewable Energy</h3>

<p>Ryan Anderson highlighted that in March, HESTA urged Woodside to consider appointing new directors with skills to address climate-related challenges. Although Anthony O'Neill, recently appointed by Woodside, was not nominated by the fund, this move indicates growing investor focus on corporate governance and environmental responsibility.</p>

<p>The Australian government has been calling for the development of new natural gas resources to ensure reasonable gas prices while maintaining its status as a major exporter. This is the latest move by the center-left Labor government to increase support for fossil fuels. Previously, the Australian government released a long-term framework called the "Future Gas Strategy," aiming to define the role of natural gas in the transition to clean energy and achieve the net-zero emissions target by 2050.</p>

<p>Ryan Anderson noted that although this strategy was warmly welcomed by the industry, environmental groups and left-wing lawmakers were furious. Green Party leader Adam Bandt accused Labor of being "climate fraudsters." However, the government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, elected in May 2022, has strong power to take tough action on climate change.</p>

<h3>Investor Strategies</h3>

<p>Ryan Anderson pointed out that the Minister for Resources of of Australia, Madeleine King stated in an interview that there is currently no substitute for natural gas, especially in critical mineral processing or some high-heat manufacturing uses. She emphasized that while hoping to use hydrogen in the future, actions cannot be based on mere wishes without backup plans.</p>

<p>As part of the strategy, Madeleine King threatened to consider strengthening the "use it or lose it" provisions in federal leasing retention policies to encourage faster development of potential sites. Australian Energy Producers CEO Samantha McCulloch stated that the Australian market needs significant new investments to avoid a shortage of funds.</p>

<p>Overall, Ryan Anderson believes that although natural gas will remain an important part of the energy structure of Australia in the short term, the long-term development of renewable energy cannot be overlooked. Investors should focus on the structural changes in the energy sector and allocate assets appropriately to achieve long-term stable investment returns.</p>
