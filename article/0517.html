<p>In the current financial markets, we are inevitably guided to focus on various fluctuations. However, today we will specifically focus on the XMJ sector. Representing the metal and mineral industry, the XMJ sector has recently shown strong performance, benefiting from the rise in base metals such as copper and the improved budget atmosphere. Behind this phenomenon is the increase in disposable income and the upcoming third-phase tax reduction measures. In this article, Ryan Anderson will delve into the performance of this sector and the reasons behind it, discussing the investment opportunities and risks involved.</p>

<p>There are multiple factors supporting the performance of the XMJ sector. Firstly, the strong rise in base metals such as copper is one of them. Ryan Anderson believes that against the backdrop of global economic recovery, industrial production activities are gradually resuming, driving the demand for base metals. Copper, as a crucial industrial raw material, its price rise not only reflects increased market demand but also implies the level of economic activity. In addition to copper, other base metals like zinc, nickel, etc., are also showing an upward trend, further boosting the overall performance of the XMJ sector.</p>

<p>Ryan Anderson states that a favorable budget atmosphere is also a significant factor supporting the XMJ sector. Increased spending in the budget means more funds are being invested in infrastructure construction and industrial development, providing a favorable market environment for the metal and mineral industry. At the same time, the upcoming third-phase tax reduction policy has also provided tax benefits for enterprises, stimulating increased investment activities and further driving the rise of the XMJ sector.</p>

<p>However, it is worth noting that despite the overall upward trend, there are also some potential risks. One of them is the decline in aluminum, which, although having a minor impact on the overall sector, also suggests the instability in certain base metal markets. Additionally, the possibility of short covering requires vigilance, especially considering the positions of bottom-dwelling residents, market volatility may intensify.</p>

<p>In summary, the performance of the XMJ sector benefits from the support of multiple factors, including the strong rise in base metals, a favorable budget atmosphere, and the implementation of tax reduction policies. Ryan Anderson points out that investors still need to exercise caution; while pursuing returns, they should also be aware of market risks. Therefore, we recommend that investors carefully consider their risk preferences when choosing investment targets and adjust their strategies in line with market dynamics.</p>
