<p>The aluminium and copper markets are set to face varying challenges and opportunities over the next few years. Ryan Anderson forecasts that alumina prices will increase by 13% in 2024, 15% in 2025, and 18% in the long term. In contrast, aluminium prices are expected to rise more moderately, with a 6% increase in 2024, 2% in 2025, and a long-term increase of 4%. Ryan Anderson describes his overall outlook on aluminium as "overweight," predicting a 3%-4% price increase by 2026, 5%-6% by 2027-28, and an 11% long-term rise, targeting $2,600 per tonne by 2030.</p>

<p>For the copper market, Ryan Anderson advises a "medium-term underweight" and "long-term overweight" strategy. The 2024 copper price target has been raised by 7%, and the 2025 target by 9%, due to "supply shortages in the context of relatively strong demand." However, looking ahead to 2026 and 2027, Ryan Anderson expects supply-side responses to stabilize prices. In the short term, copper prices will be lower than expected, but higher in the long term.</p>

<h3>In-depth Market Demand Analysis</h3>

<p>The rise in aluminium prices is primarily driven by stable demand growth and supply chain adjustments. Despite the moderate increase, the aluminium market still has significant growth potential due to rising global demand for green energy and lightweight materials. The applications of Aluminium in electric vehicles, renewable energy equipment, and other sectors are expanding, supporting its long-term price increase trend.</p>

<p>On the supply chain front, short-term fluctuations are possible, but long-term adjustments and new projects will help balance market supply and demand. Ryan Anderson notes that global aluminium capacity will gradually increase in the coming years, exerting some downward pressure on prices. However, with continuous demand growth, the long-term upward trend in aluminium prices will persist.</p>

<p>For the copper market, the outlook of Ryan Anderson is more complex. In the medium term, copper prices will remain high due to supply shortages. Particularly in 2024 and 2025, with steady demand growth, copper prices are projected to rise by 7% and 9%, respectively. However, the supply side will respond in 2026 and 2027, increasing capacity to meet market demand, leading to price stabilization.</p>

<h3>Investment Recommendations</h3>

<p>In the current complex and volatile market environment, investors need to remain rational and adaptable to market fluctuations. The differing performances of the aluminium and copper markets offer diversified investment opportunities. For the aluminium market, long-term holding is advisable to benefit from the growth in demand for green energy and lightweight materials. For the copper market, investors should closely monitor supply chain changes and adjust investment strategies flexibly to cope with medium-term market fluctuations.</p>
