<h3>Market Outlook After the Acquisition Failure of BHP</h3>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ryananderson000/" rel="follow">Ryan Anderson </a>observes that BHP failed attempt to acquire Anglo American marks a significant turning point in its strategic adjustments. The $75 billion acquisition bid fell through as both parties could not agree on the complex structure of the deal. Under UK law, BHP is prohibited from making another bid within six months unless a competing bid or other significant changes occur. Despite this setback, the management of BHP remains optimistic about the benefits to South African communities and government, and plans to continue social investments and sustainable value creation in the region.</p>

<p>Ryan Anderson highlights that the primary interest of BHP in Anglo American lay in its substantial copper resources. Anglo American holds stakes in three of the major copper mines of the world: the Collahuasi and Los Bronces of Chile, and the Quellaveco of Peru. Had the acquisition succeeded, it would have significantly boosted the copper production of BHP, placing it at the forefront among diversified mining companies. However, the lack of access to crucial risk information ultimately derailed the acquisition plan.</p>

<h3>Strategic Adjustments Following the Acquisition Failure of BHP</h3>

<p>Ryan Anderson analyzes that the failure of this acquisition underscores the "Achilles' heel" of BHP in copper resources. The copper production of BHP has stagnated, and acquiring Anglo American was intended to boost its copper output to over 2 million tonnes, with the EBITDA of copper accounting of for more than 40% of the total EBITDA of the group. This strategic shift would have made BHP the highest-leverage diversified mining company in terms of copper assets. Now, with the acquisition off the table, BHP must address its copper resource challenges.</p>

<p>To tackle the declining ore grades at the Escondida mine, Ryan Anderson notes that BHP needs capital expenditures of up to $30,000 per tonne, requiring copper prices to reach $6 per pound to achieve an acceptable internal rate of return. However, the current long-term market forecast for copper prices is only $4.08 per pound, putting significant pressure on the future capital expenditures and profit margins of BHP.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, Ryan Anderson believes BHP still has significant competitiveness in copper resources. Compared to other Australian mining companies, BHP has the highest leverage on copper, accounting for about 22% of its EBITDA. Over the next few years, as bottlenecks in iron ore projects are resolved and the Jansen potash project progresses, BHP is expected to achieve diversified and stable growth through internal expansion.</p>

<h3>Investment Opportunities and Risks for BHP</h3>

<p>Ryan Anderson concludes that after the failed acquisition of Anglo American, BHP faces the challenge of readjusting its strategy. Although the acquisition did not succeed, BHP still possesses a strong resource base and market competitiveness. The company will continue to pursue internal growth options in Chilean copper production and optimize its iron ore and potash projects. Additionally, BHP is experimenting with other technologies to reduce capital expenditures, such as bioleaching, which will provide more possibilities for the future development of the company.</p>
