<h3>U.S. Stocks Hit New Highs</h3>

<p>Recently, the U.S. stock market has reached new historical highs, with the S&P 500 closing higher, marking the 31st record high this year. Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales data fell short of expectations, providing more support for a rate cut in September but also raising concerns about slowing economic growth, leading to lower bond yields. Citi, Goldman Sachs, and Evercore have all raised their year-end targets for the S&P 500. Ryan Anderson believes that given the current complex and ever-changing market dynamics, investors need to closely monitor these changes and adjust their investment strategies to achieve optimal returns.</p>

<h3>Market Dynamics Analysis</h3>

<p>The recent performance of the U.S. stock market has been remarkable, with the S&P 500 setting its 31st record high this year. Ryan Anderson notes that despite the decline in most large tech stocks, the strong performance of Nvidia has led it to surpass Microsoft as the most valuable company of the world. This shift reflects the high focus and optimistic expectations of the market on artificial intelligence and technological innovation.</p>

<p>U.S. retail sales data coming in weaker than expected supports a potential rate cut in September but also raises concerns about economic slowdown. Anderson points out that the weak retail sales data reflects uncertainty in consumer spending, which could pressure future economic growth. Lower bond yields further indicate market worries about the economic outlook, suggesting that investors should closely watch upcoming economic data to adjust their investment strategies promptly.</p>

<h3>Central Bank Policies and Market Expectations</h3>

<p>Bank of Japan Governor Ueda hinted at a possible rate hike in July, the Reserve Bank of Australia held rates steady but did not rule out further hikes, and the Bank of Korea suggested a rate cut by the end of the year. Ryan Anderson states that these policy adjustments by central banks will have broad impacts on global markets, especially concerning interest rates and inflation expectations. Investors should closely follow these policy changes to adjust their strategies accordingly.</p>

<p>Additionally, as the appeal of the dollar declines, global central banks are expected to increase their gold reserves over the next year, which could positively impact the precious metals market. Anderson suggests that investors might consider increasing their gold allocations to hedge against market uncertainties and currency fluctuations.</p>

<h3>Investor Sentiment and Market Trends</h3>

<p>The latest Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey shows investor optimism at its highest level since November 2021, though it has not reached extreme levels. Cash levels are at 4.0%, the lowest since June 2021. Since November 2022, investors have generally increased their stock holdings while reducing bond holdings. Soft landing has become a consensus, with hard landing views at a new low.</p>

<p>Additionally, regarding cash usage, 26% of companies should return capital to shareholders, the highest level since April 2024, while 35% of companies plan to increase capital expenditures. This shows increased corporate confidence in future development, indicating that investors should pay attention to corporate buybacks and capital expenditure trends to seize market opportunities.</p>
