<p>During the recent Republican National Convention, Trump once again emerged as the presidential candidate and elaborated on economic policies. These policies include tax cuts, maintaining low interest rates, expanding oil drilling, and supporting cryptocurrencies. These measures are expected to significantly impact global stock markets. Ryan Anderson delves into the economic rationale behind these policies and their potential specific effects on global stock markets, particularly in the current complex and volatile global economic environment.</p>

<h2>Core Elements of Trump Economic Policies and Their Impact on Stock Markets</h2>

<p>Trump economic strategy primarily revolves around tax cuts and maintaining low interest rates. Ryan Anderson points out that this strategy aims to stimulate corporate investment and consumer spending, thereby driving economic growth. A low-tax environment attracts domestic and international companies to increase investments in the United States, potentially boosting corporate profit expectations in the stock market. Simultaneously, a low-interest-rate environment reduces borrowing costs, enhancing market liquidity. However, these policies may also heighten inflation expectations, exerting pressure on the stock market. Through detailed analysis, Ryan Anderson suggests that while investors may benefit from the short-term advantages of these policies, they should remain vigilant about long-term inflation risks and uncertainties stemming from policy changes.</p>

<h2>Shifts in US Energy Policy and Global Market Impact</h2>

<p>The Trump administration energy policy, particularly the proposal to expand oil and natural gas drilling, is expected to have profound implications for the global energy market. Ryan Anderson analyzes that this policy could not only lower energy costs but also bolster US competitiveness in the global energy market. However, this reliance on fossil fuels may run counter to global decarbonization trends, potentially leading to complex and varied reactions from global markets towards US energy stocks. In examining these changes, Ryan Anderson advises investors that while this may boost stock prices in related industries in the short term, the increasing global demand for renewable energy and uncertainties in environmental policies could pose risks to long-term investment returns.</p>

<h2>Global Market Responses to Trump Financial and Economic Policies</h2>

<p>Ryan Anderson notes that although Trump policies may positively impact certain industries like oil and gas in the short term, a relaxed stance on environmental policies could face widespread international criticism. In the long term, this might affect the United States leadership in global environmental issues. Ryan Anderson also highlights uncertainties in the technology sector. Trump regulatory stance on big tech companies could alter their operating environments domestically and internationally. Particularly in the cryptocurrency and social media sectors, policy uncertainties could directly affect stock prices and investment dynamics.</p>

<p>Amid the increasingly interconnected global economy nowadays, Trump economic policies not only influence the United States but could also trigger fluctuations in global markets. Ryan Anderson emphasizes that global investors should closely monitor US policy developments, especially in the areas of tax cuts, low interest rates, and energy policies. Investors need to build a diversified portfolio to navigate the uncertainties and potential market volatility arising from policy changes. Additionally, Ryan Anderson underscores the importance of the cryptocurrency market as an emerging investment field, particularly in the context of seeking alternative investment channels within the traditional financial system.</p>
