<h3>U.S. Treasury Yields Rebound</h3>

<p>U.S. Treasury yields continued to rebound for the third consecutive trading day on Monday, correcting the decline of last week caused by easing inflation pressures. <a target="_blank" href="https://community.wongcw.com/RyanAnderson/" rel="follow">Ryan Anderson</a> noted that despite the absence of significant economic data releases on the day, the attention of investors shifted to recent comments from several Federal Reserve officials and a series of investment-grade bond issuances. This shift indicates a heightened market focus on monetary policy direction and capital market dynamics.</p>

<h3>Market Reaction and Expectations Adjustment</h3>

<p>A massive sell-off in the futures market pushed Treasury yields lower, especially around 8:20 AM Eastern Time, when there was a surge in 10-year Treasury futures trading. Ryan Anderson believes that this phenomenon may be partly influenced by corporate bond issuance activities, which could technically pressure the market. Although economic data remained relatively flat, frequent speeches from Federal Reserve officials became the focal point for the market.</p>

<p>Despite the April CPI data easing inflation pressures and market expectations of last week on two rate cuts by the Fed this year, the statement of Vice Chair Jefferson suggested it was too early to determine if the inflation process could sustain. This uncertainty contributed to market volatility. Additionally, the differing views among Fed officials on monetary policy require market participants to carefully evaluate future economic data and balance risks to avoid potential market volatility.</p>

<h3>Minutes Providing Rate Path Clues</h3>

<p>With no significant economic data releases on Monday and Tuesday, the upcoming Fed minutes are expected to keep the bond market relatively calm. Investors will closely monitor the minutes for any clues about the rate path to guide future investment decisions. Ryan Anderson pointed out that although Treasury yields experienced slight fluctuations, overall market volatility remained within 3 basis points, indicating a relatively calm market environment.</p>

<p>Despite the overall calm market, the futures market showed new signs of shorting U.S. Treasuries. Increased activity in 2-year and 5-year Treasury futures trading suggests that traders might have postponed their expectations of Fed rate cuts and established new short positions. This change implies a degree of uncertainty among market participants about the future economic trajectory, necessitating cautious responses to potential risks and opportunities.</p>

<h3>Fed Minutes and Investment Strategies</h3>

<p>Ryan Anderson advises that with the release of the Fed minutes, investors will have an opportunity to gain further insights into the policy stance and future direction of the Fed. The rate path clues provided in the minutes will significantly impact both the bond and stock markets, so investors should closely monitor and adjust their investment strategies based on market dynamics.</p>
