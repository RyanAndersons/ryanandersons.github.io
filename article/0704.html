<p>The major U.S. benchmark indices saw modest gains in relatively calm overnight trading, with the equal-weighted S&P 500 index falling by 0.38%, trailing the official index by 54 basis points. Noteworthy large-cap stocks included Apple (+2.0%), Amazon (+3.9%), and Tesla (+4.8%). The AI boom propelled the market capitalization of Amazon beyond $2 trillion. Meanwhile, Ryan Anderson sees investment opportunities in value stocks, noting their very low price-to-earnings ratios. Additionally, Andurand Capital exited its long positions in oil, shifting towards copper and cocoa. Options traders are betting that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 300 basis points by the end of Q1 2025, while the U.S. Department of Energy reported unexpected increases in crude oil and gasoline inventories, leading to a drop in oil prices.</p>

<h3>Strong Performance of Major Tech Stocks</h3>

<p>Apple, Amazon, and Tesla stood out in the trading of yesterday, rising by 2.0%, 3.9%, and 4.8%, respectively. Amazon, in particular, surged past the $2 trillion market cap mark, driven by the AI craze. Ryan Anderson highlights that the robust performance of these large-cap stocks not only reflects market confidence in their growth prospects but also underscores investor recognition of their technological innovation and market leadership.</p>

<h3>Investment Opportunities in Value Stocks</h3>

<p>Despite the stellar performance of large-cap stocks, Bank of America strategists see opportunities in value stocks, which currently have very low price-to-earnings ratios. Ryan Anderson notes that value stocks typically perform well during periods of economic uncertainty because they usually have stable earnings and lower market expectations. Investors should focus on companies with strong fundamentals and low valuations, taking advantage of market volatility for strategic allocation.</p>

<h3>The Position Adjustment of Andurand Capital</h3>

<p>Andurand Capital has exited its long positions in oil, shifting towards copper and cocoa. Ryan Anderson interprets this move as a reflection of differing expectations for the future commodity markets. Copper, as a key industrial metal, is closely tied to global economic growth, while cocoa is significantly influenced by supply-demand dynamics and climate change. Investors should monitor these commodity markets to make appropriate adjustments to their portfolios.</p>

<h3>Fed Rate Cut Expectations and Falling Oil Prices</h3>

<p>Options traders are betting that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 300 basis points by the end of Q1 2025. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Energy reported unexpected increases in crude oil and gasoline inventories, causing oil prices to fall. Ryan Anderson points out that rate cut expectations typically have a positive impact on the stock market because a lower interest rate environment helps stimulate economic growth. However, falling oil prices could negatively affect energy stocks, so investors should be cautious of volatility in this sector.</p>
